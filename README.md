##Conclusion

Price Analysis: High Prices: Central Manhattan, particularly around tourist hotspots, shows higher prices. Moderate to Low Prices: Listings in Queens and most of Brooklyn are generally more affordable. Outliers: Some listings in less central areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn still command high prices, possibly due to unique features or luxury accommodations. 
Review Analysis: Based on the scatter plot, regression line, and correlation analysis, we might conclude that the number of reviews has a negligible effect on the price of Airbnb listings in New York. This suggests that while reviews are important for guests making a booking decision, they do not significantly influence the pricing strategy of hosts.
Availability Analysis: Based on the analysis, Manhattan had the highest number of available AirBnBs and places like Staten Island and the bronx are untapped markets.Also, availability influences reviews slightly positively.
